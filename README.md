# Lukas Batema
Hello guys and gals, I am Lukas Batema. I am a 16 year old male. I know tons of different programming languages, like HTML, CSS, Java, and more! I like to solve the Rubik's Cube. I am what they call a speedcuber. That is a person whom does the act of solving the Rubik's Cube in a quick and successful manner. I also enjoy playing Minecraft. I am staff on the server, "PedestriaMC Network." I have been working tirelessly on a wiki for the server, which released on the 19th of January, 2021. I am currently building a PC, so you might not see me as active for a bit. My favourite song is, "Never be Alone," by TheFatRat. It is a great so g to listen to when you are feeling down! 

If you need anyone to talk to, or need to message me for anyother reason, please contact me at my [email](mailto:lukasbatema@gmail.com), or attempt to contact me on my Discord (HogaticCultist19#0119), although my email is preferred and responded to the quickest!
